# Accidents  事故

I wonder how many accidents I’ve had in my life.                            
我想知道我一生中有多少事故。

I’ve had a few serious ones where I’ve ended up in hospital.                
我有幾場嚴重的事故，其中我最終進了醫院。

Traffic accidents are the worst.                                            
交通事故是最糟糕的。

They’re always painful.                                                     
它們總是很痛苦。

I haven’t had too many work-related accidents.                              
我沒有太多工作相關的事故。

I suppose that’s because I do office work and that’s not so dangerous.      
我想這是因為我做辦公室工作，而且不是很危險。

Most of my accidents are those around the house.                            
我大部分的事故都是在家裡。

I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve hit my thumb with a hammer.     
我已經數不清我有多少次用錘子敲到了我的拇指。

I’m also really good at standing up and hitting my head on something.       
我也很擅長站起來，撞到某物。

I’m not as bad as my friend though.                                         
但我不像我的朋友那樣。

He’s a real accident looking for somewhere to happen.                       
他真的是個尋找發生事故的地方的事故。

Almost every time we meet,                                                  
幾乎每次我們見面，
he has some story to tell about his latest accident.                        
他都有一個故事要告訴我他最近的事故。

He’s quite unbelievable.                                                    
他非常令人難以置信。

I think I’d be very worried if I were his mother.                           
我想如果我是他的母親，我會非常擔心。
